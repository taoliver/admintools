Things still to do
==================


ideas
=====

subclass AdminScript/AdminThread
  for each type of script eg VM/backup/test

catch qt.quit etc and use dialog to say no if long job running

animation

styles

view/browse old log files
  separate tab or on subject tab?
  display file listings in tree structure
    can close/open branches to make navigation much easier

info tab
  disk space
misc commands tab

keyboard navigation

~/data/projects/qt
  not ~/projects/qt
    avoid duplicates and warnings
    soft link issues?

check process return value on exit
  for vm start/stop etc
  viewer disconnect
  change button enable/disable

.wait after stopping process?

doxygen
  not supported directly yet in QtCreator?

qsTr everywhere
  have a look at Qt internationalisation

re-create app in just C++ and also in Python/QML for comparison


bugs
====

program not stopping on exit sometimes?
  because thread exits with error?

TextArea scroll not quite right
