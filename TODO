Things still to do
==================


ideas
=====

subclass AdminScript/AdminThread
  for each type of script eg VM/backup/test

animation

styles

view/browse old log files
  separate tab or on subject tab?
  display file listings in tree structure
    can close/open branches to make navigation much easier

info tab
  disk space
misc commands tab

keyboard navigation

~/data/projects/qt
  not ~/projects/qt
    avoid duplicates and warnings
    soft link issues?

check process return value on exit
  for vm start/stop etc
  viewer disconnect
  change button enable/disable

.wait after stopping process?

doxygen
  not supported directly yet in QtCreator?

re-create app in just C++ and also in Python/QML for comparison

allow multiple backups/VM commands in-flight at once?
  status bar: which does it show - or several?
    don't use app status bar
    use split horizontal window layout for main qml and
    show status of all in-flight commands 1 per line in lower split window
  command pane:
    includes command input, buttons and output pane
    combobox at top to choose running command to display plus NEW command
  will require multiple adminscript objects in each qml file
    not one global one
  output pane: show command as Text then output in TextArea below
               also Stop button beside command


bugs
====

program not stopping on exit sometimes?
  because thread exits with error?

TextArea scroll not quite right
